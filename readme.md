# Roulette Bot by SyfuxX

My bot is playing with the princip of 100% chance to win in Casino Roulette, it was made for a friend who uses this method since months.  

## Recommendation

### Bet365

Online Casino Website with Roulette and Live Roulette, maximum is 150€ to place, so the tables aren't very good for our Trick, but you can play with the Bot on this Webpage.

Bot doesn't work for Live Roulette.

### CasinoClub

Online Casino and have an Application with much Roulettes, maximum is 1000€ to place, so the tables are good for our Trick, Bot is only configurated yet for playing with the Software and only French Roulette.

Only tested on Software and French Roulette.
